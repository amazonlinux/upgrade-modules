Directories showing up in Python's installation path, /usr/lib/python*/dist-packages, will not be owned by an RPM if they were installed using pip or other non-OS specific methods.

Be aware that any RPM owned python packages which are not signed by Amazon Linux will need to be manually reinstalled on your new system.

In addition, the python installation directory on Amazon Linux 2 has moved from /usr/lib/python*/dist-packages to the more traditional /usr/lib/python*/site-packages directory.
